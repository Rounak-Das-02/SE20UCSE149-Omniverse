# SE20UCSE149-Omniverse

Assets are included in Assets directory.

They contain different file formats. Omniverse supports different file formats. If the formats aren't compatible, the assets can be easily converted to .usd using online convertor or Unity or any other relevant software.

`environment` assets contain Roads, and Shanghai Airport model. 
`objects` assets contain Cars and Airbuses and traffic lights.

The key idea is to simulate Car traffic and Airport Traffic simultaneously at a congested place near an airport.

Relevant data for this project in mind couldn't be found on the internet. Hence it is important to generate dummy data. Once we have more information about what to do next, data can be tailored to it.
